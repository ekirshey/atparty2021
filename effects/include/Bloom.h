/*
 *  Bloom class. Compute shaders that takes the deferred lighting frame
 *  buffer and writes all the pixels that exceed a minimum luminance threshold.
 *  That min-luminance frame buffer is then gaussian blurred horizontally and
 *  vertically to create the blurry bloom effect.  The bloom frame buffer then
 *  gets added on top of the deferred frame buffer.  Eventually do HDR to prevent
 *  light clamping.
